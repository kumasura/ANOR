Objective
##
In the context of aircraft rerouting during disruptions (such as bad weather, technical failures, or airspace congestion), the goal is to find a new route that minimizes the impact on the schedule, fuel consumption, and passenger satisfaction while ensuring safety.
##
##
State space
##
Current position of the aircraft, Remaining fuel, Weather conditions, Air traffic, Available airports for emergency landings, Positions of other aircraft
##
##
Action space
##
Changing the flight path, Aircraft swapping, Flight cancellation, Altitude adjustments, Diverting to alternative airports, Waiting to conditions to improve.
##
##
Reward function
##
Fuel consumption, Delays, Passenger inconvenience, Cancellation, Swapping

1. The RL model iteratively improves the policy by interacting with the environment and updating its parameters based on the feedback (rewards) received.
2. Over time, the model learns to select actions that lead to the best outcomes in terms of minimizing disruption and optimizing the rerouting process.
